# HTML & CSS

<!-- "Entry level cert in html and css" -->

## Rules
- Keywords are placed in **angular brackets**: `<` and `>`.
- Keywords may be in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture of both, although **lower case is recommended**.
- Closing tags (e.g. "`</title>`") do not have parameters.
- Anything in angular brackets not recognised by the browser is ignored.
- Some element parameters (e.g. "align") are deprecated, so this type of styling should instead be set in CSS
  - VSCode can assist in identifying deprecated items, and provide a hover-over tip.


## Basic Format
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Test</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        Hello World!
    </body>
</html>
```

## Initial tags
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>                     All HTML documents must start with this declaration. Not case sensitive.
          html                      Here html refers to HTML5.

<html lang="en"> </html>            Root of the HTML document. All elements (excl. DOCTYPE) should fall within the <html> tags.
      lang="en"                     Always declare the language of the webpage to assist search engines and browsers.
                                      See links below for Language Codes.
```


## Head Section
```html
<head> </head>                      Container for meta data, title, embedded CSS styles.

<meta charset="UTF-8">              Metadata is information about the page. Used by browsers, search engines, and web services.
      charset="UTF-8"               Specifies the character encoding for the page.
      name="description"            Name/type of data. Here it is the page description. Paired with a "content" tag.
        content="Page description"
      name="keywords"               Keyword for search engines, e.g. content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript".
      name="viewport"               Viewport is the users visible area of a webpage. Accessing on phone, browers, etc.
        content=".., .."              Comma separated list of values:
            width=device-width          Sets page width following the width of screen on the display device.
            initial-scale=1.0           Set the initial zoom of the page when loaded the first time.

<title>My Page</title>              Page title to display in title/tab bar or bookmark. 
                                      Having a different title on every page helps with SEO.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="1.css"> Reference an external CSS style sheet.

<style> </style>                    If using Embedded styles, they should be defined in the head. Appear AFTER meta tags.
                                      See also CSS notes.
```


## Body Section

### Semantic Tags
Non-semantic elements:
- Examples: `<div>` and `<span>`
- Donâ€™t provide any inherent meaning.

Semantic elements:
- **Clearly describe their meaning** to both browser and developer. 
- Help **structure a web page** by defining different parts of its content.
- **Improve accessibility**.
- Makes HTML code **more meaningful** and **easier to understand** for both developers and search engines.

```html
<header>  </header>                 A header section within a document. Can contain other tags, such as <h1>, <p>, etc.

<footer>  </footer>                 A footer section. Can contain other tags, such as <h1>, <p>, etc.

<nav>     </nav>                    Represents a navigation menu. Use it for site navigation links, such as <ul> or a <table>:
                                        <nav>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> |
                                                <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
                                                <!-- More navigation items -->
                                            </ul>
                                        </nav>

<article> </article>                Specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own and can 
                                     be distributed independently from the rest of the website. Use it for blog posts, forum threads, 
                                     or news articles. May typically contain <h1>, <p>, etc tags.

<section> </section>                Defines a thematic grouping of content with a heading. It can represent chapters, introduction, 
                                     or other related sections. May typically contain <h1>, <p>, etc tags.

<details> </details>                Defines additional details that can be opened (display content) or closed (default) on demand.

  <summary> </summary>              Defines *visible* heading for <details> element which can be clicked to view/hide the details.
                                        Note: Must be the first child element within <details>.

<main>    </main>                   Defines the main content of a document. There should be only one <main> per page.

<figure>  </figure>                 Specifies self-contained content (e.g. images/diagrams/code). May contain <img> for example.

  <figcaption> </figcaption>        Defines a caption for the <figure> element.
```


### General Tags
```html
<div>     </div>                    Division. Contains any other elements. Useful for applying specific styles. Causes line break.

<p>       </p>                      Paragraph.
     style="text-align:right"         Specify alignment via style ("align" keyword is deprecated).

<span>    </span>                   Can define a section of a line, without getting line breaks (unlike a div which will break).
```


### Lists
```html
<ul>      </ul>                     Unordered (bulleted) list.

<ol>      </ol>                     Ordered (numbered) list.

  <li>List item 1</li>              List items are enclosed in <li> tags, and appear within <ul> or <ol> sections.
```


### Tables
```html
<table  > </table>                  Open a table. Tables very useful for controlling page layout. Use CSS to style.
    width="100%"                      Define the width of the table relative to the browser window.
    border="0"                        DEPRECATED. Define the border. Use CSS to do this instead.
    align="center"                    DEPRECATED. Alignment. Use CSS instead.

  <tr>    </tr>                     Open a table row.

    <th>Header 1</th>               Define a table header column (inside row).

    <td>Data 1</td>                 Define a table data/cell (inside a row). Use a different row to the header.
      colspan="2"                     Let the cell span two cells (compared to other rows).
      style="color: red;"             Apply CSS styling directly to a cell. (External CSS preferrable.)
```


### Forms
- Can interweave a table into a form, to assist with **aligning fields** as required.
```html
<form>      </form>                 Open a form.
  action="[URL]"                      Where to send data when submitted. E.g. "http://localhost:3000/submit".
  method="post"                       Method to use. GET: Get webpage, POST: Send data.

  <label >  </label>                A label to be used for a form field. Can appear before or after input element.
    for="username"                    Expclicitly associate the label with the field by name. Makes label clickable.

  <input >                          Input field on form. Can be one of many different types. No closing tag.
    type="text"                       Type of input - text / email / password / etc.

      name="gender"                     Name used for submission but also for grouping radio fields.
      value="male"                      Value to be sent back on submission.
    
  <select >     </select>           Dropdown selection.
    id="country"                      Identifier.
    name="country"                    Name for submission

    <option >USA</option>             Options inside the <select>. Use text inside <option> tags for displaying in dropdown.
        value="usa"                     Value to return if option chosen in dropdown.
